# Election_Analysis

## Overview
This challenge involved working with Tom (an employee of a Colorado elections board) to assist him collate results for US congressional precinct in the state during the election. A code was generated to calculate the results from mail-in ballots, punch cards and direct recording electronic (DRE) counting machines. Python was used as a tool to automate the election results to report the total number and percentage per candidate of votes cast in order to determine the winner of the election. Our final Python script was run to give us the total number of votes cast, complete list of candidates who received votes, total number of votes each candidate received, percentage of votes each candidate won and the winner of the election based on popular vote.

A vote count report was generated to certify this US congressional race as explained in the report below.
